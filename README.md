Pantella SexLab Support is a mod that adds support to Pantella for SexLab. It operates as an example of how to make an addon for Pantella, and as a basic SexLab integration for Pantella. It allows NPCs to trigger SexLab animations, and adds awareness of any ongoing animations and who's participating in them to Pantella's AI.

## Requirements
- [Pantella](https://github.com/Pathos14489/Pantella)
- SexLab 1.66 or later (Might work with earlier versions, but not tested)

## Installation

Drag the sexlab folder into your Pantella repository's `addons` folder. And install the latest PantellaSL.zip from the latest release file with your mod manager like any other mod.
